## About

This repo was meant to house the frontend infrastructure for my web app Tweetmarker, a smart manager for your bookmarked Tweets. Twitter's current website doesn't support organizing your bookmarked tweets into a directory-based system (for example, "Breaking Bad Meme Collection", "Cool NBA Infographics"), nor does it let you look up a bookmarked tweet by certain characteristics (by Author, time of creation, contained text) etc. I was building this website to support these limitations, until Elon announced that he was temporarily revoking free access to the Twitter API. I was still in the process of adding the database functionality to support creating folders to store bookmarked tweets, but it seems as if that is no longer achieveable (for the time being). Consider this project defunct.
